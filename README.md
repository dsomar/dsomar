# I'm hiring 👋
I'm a full stack Sr. Designer at Knowde.com where we are builing the largest B2B marketplace on 🌎 Earth. Want to join our design and product team?  Check out our open roles [here](https://knowde.com/careers)

## My Design Philosophy
Focus on the POGO:
- Pains
- Obstacles
- Goals
- (and) Objectives

I wrote about it [here] (https://medium.com/@DenisSomar/the-stupidly-simple-pogo-framework-for-building-amazing-ux-products-8a17662b4543) and it's a great way to stay focused on being pragmatic and delivering real results to the real people using whatever we design/build.

## Other Things I Enjoy
- ☕️
- 🍎
- 🏃‍♂️
